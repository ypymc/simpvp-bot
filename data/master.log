<Mac9308> Going alright, how about you?
<ypy> pretty awesome despite shitty wifi
<Mac9308> Lol that's good
<Mac9308> Have you played this server recently or has it been a while?
<ypy> it's been quite a long time. i've been traveling for the past month and havent had much internet
<ypy> and before that i was busy with life etc
<Mac9308> Alright
<Mac9308> Where have you gone to?
<ypy> thailand, cambodia, malaysia
<Mac9308> Did you enjoy it?
<ypy> it's great. i'm back in thailand now. i could get used to this life
<ypy> the whole "not working" thing has been quite relaxing
<Mac9308> Lol
<Mac9308> Are you currently residing there, or are you in a hotel?
<ypy> not residing anywhere. i sold everything I owned in the USA. been staying in hostels
<ypy> highly recommended.
<Mac9308> In hotels?
<ypy> hostels. like, dorm bed kind of situations with travellers. not as nice as a hotel :)
<Mac9308> How much is it per night?
<ypy> depends where I am. tonight I'm paying like 300 baht... so $9 USD i guess?
<Mac9308> 9 dollars a night omg
<ypy> but I've stayed in places for twice that, and places for half that amount
<Mac9308> Still, I could like run away from home and be fine for at least a year
<Mac9308> lol
<ypy> dude yeah. that's what i'm doing. do it
<Mac9308> What's it like in Malaysa?
<ypy> i was pretty scared leading up to this but it's the best decision I ever made
<ypy> malaysia was great. Did a lot of jungle trekking etc. really beautiful country
<Mac9308> Oh sorry I thought you said you were in Malaysia , not Thailand
<ypy> I'm back in thailand now
<Mac9308> Yeah my bad
<Mac9308> what's Thailand like, then?
<ypy> Pretty awesome. tonight I got drunk with a bunch of french people
<Mac9308> lol
<ypy> had a meal, like 6 beers, 2 cups of coffee... 300 baht? so i guess that's another $9
<ypy> it's the fuckin life
<Mac9308> Lol. Do you live in the city?
<Mac9308> Or I guess near it?
<ypy> I'm in pretty central bangkok now, yeah
<ypy> they have a curfew due to the military coup that I'm about to go break
<Mac9308> Alright
<Mac9308> Military coup?
<ypy> yeah, the military overthrew the goverment here a few weeks ago
<ypy> i'm gonna go venture out in search of cigarettes
<Mac9308> So you simply can't go outside after some certain hour?
<ypy> if I don't come back in 10 mins please send bail money to the thai army
<ypy> yeah. nobody on the streets after midnight aka 35 mins ago
<Mac9308> Bail money = another 9 dollars xD

<el_andres96> Not sure if you can tell
<EricCMiller> Im getting vertigo looking down

<el_andres96> He removed them and built them further
<EricCMiller> yeah I they weren't that far out whne I was around last
<el_andres96> We should go get the horses it will be faster
<el_andres96> morl0ck removed the patio here
<el_andres96> He didn't like it I think
<EricCMiller> I remember that statue
<el_andres96> Tr0pical built these towers here
<el_andres96> Lots of details on them
<EricCMiller> they look great
<el_andres96> They do
<EricCMiller> I can never build anything so detailed
<el_andres96> This is how much the walls got expanded
<EricCMiller> I lost you
<el_andres96> This is the mini iron farm
<EricCMiller> cool
<el_andres96> This is a decoration building

<el_andres96> That random portal is not supposed to be there
<el_andres96> No idea why it's there
<EricCMiller> it's been revamped
<el_andres96> Yeah we also covered every evidence at the top so people can't find us
<EricCMiller> nice
<el_andres96> The dual blaze farm is a bit hard to get to
<EricCMiller> i know of hte new pertals
<EricCMiller> portals
<el_andres96> very handy
<EricCMiller> indeed
<el_andres96> Shiiett
<el_andres96> That's what I meant by a bit hard to get to
<EricCMiller> damn
<el_andres96> We didn't connect the portals to the hut because it's too in the open
<EricCMiller> I grabbed most
<EricCMiller> think thats it
<el_andres96> trying to figure out the way in again
<el_andres96> Here
<EricCMiller> its nbd if you done

<el_andres96> Haha yeah
<el_andres96> morl0ck made it
<EricCMiller> hes a champ
<el_andres96> No idea when he made this
<EricCMiller> that was tight

<el_andres96> you go in here
<EricCMiller> o shyt
<el_andres96> destroy a block of that portal and go in the nether, go through the normal portal
<el_andres96> and makes a new one

sebacogliati2000 joined the game
<sebacogliati2000> hey
<EggTheif> hello
<CreaPat> hello, sebi
<sebacogliati2000> is there an admin online?
<Maconishma> Yes
<CreaPat> perche?
<sebacogliati2000> My brother's account was banned, even though he hasn't played on the server for about 5 months...
<sebacogliati2000> "xraying"
<Maconishma> that's sad
<EggTheif> crime doesn't pay
<sebacogliati2000> seriously though, he hasn't hacked and he hasn't played minecraft in AT LEAST 5 months
<sebacogliati2000> bianchinaric
<CreaPat> I remember him
Mac9308 joined the game
<sebacogliati2000> I know, we just noticed
<Mac9308> that lag though
clipchip joined the game
<sebacogliati2000> last time he logged in was at least 1-2 months ago, he was on maybe for 5 minutes or so
<Mac9308> who was abnned?
<Mac9308> I remember that name
<sebacogliati2000> To my knowledge he doesn't have any hacks installed
<Maconishma> Why are you so concerned about your brother
<sebacogliati2000> he's 11, I don't think he's even able to install them though
<sebacogliati2000> what do you mean?
<Maconishma> Why come on and plead his case so mucch
<sebacogliati2000> he's asking me why he's been banned
<Maconishma> much*
<Maconishma> Then tell him
<Maconishma> You know why he was banned
<Mac9308> sebacogliati probably he did that
<Maconishma> If he wants to make a ban appeal go on the forums
<Mac9308> don't forget your brother can easily lie
<sebacogliati2000> yeah but he's stating that he didn't do anything wrong and honestly I doubt he was hacking
<Mac9308> well that doesn't make it true
<sebacogliati2000> He's 11 and wouldn't have any reason not to tell me the truth
<Mac9308> when i was 11 i had plenty of reason to lie
<clipchip> friendly reminder: sebacogliati2000 is wearing a troll face skin and most likely 15
<sebacogliati2000> ok, I gues...
<katrina47> most 11 year olds lie
<EggTheif> lol
<sebacogliati2000> what's up clipchip
<Mac9308> He was probably sitting on and cursing all the time
<Mac9308> yup
<sebacogliati2000> lol
<EggTheif> called on your shit

<Air_Rick> looking back it was weird as shit
<Air_Rick> dat sunset
<el_andres96> I can't even render the bottom
<el_andres96> barely lol
<Air_Rick> same haha
<el_andres96> drops come here
<el_andres96> Or should, not sure if the item elevator is broken or not
<el_andres96> We have sticks for a lifetime
<el_andres96> and lots of bottles
<Air_Rick> mm spider eyes
<Air_Rick> Im just gonna grab half a stack to munch on
<el_andres96> lol
<el_andres96> Dont die
<Air_Rick> is that safe?
<el_andres96> Yeah
<Air_Rick> shyyyyyyt
<el_andres96> I think Artz did a shifting floor
<el_andres96> So the second they spawn they drop
<el_andres96> Yeah they get pushed down
<Air_Rick> it amazes me how much you can do with redstone machines
<el_andres96> Yeah, tons of stuff
<el_andres96> not sure whats on the bottom
<el_andres96> probably just a tall drop
staralien61 joined the game
<Air_Rick> brb 30 sec
<el_andres96> not sure how he gets the items up either
<Air_Rick> back
<el_andres96> wb
<Air_Rick> thanks
<el_andres96> Aparently it's just a drop onto hoppers
<Air_Rick> word
<el_andres96> then I guess the items get transfered somewhere
<el_andres96> We used to have 4 iron golems that auto killed the witches before
<Air_Rick> drops probably simpler
<el_andres96> Trying to find where the items go
<el_andres96> do you have an enderpearl?
<Air_Rick> naw
<el_andres96> There's one there but I don't think 1 is enough to get in and out
<Air_Rick> from what, the iron farm?
<el_andres96> That drop
<el_andres96> Where the hoppers are
<el_andres96> I want to see where the items go
<Air_Rick> for what the witch farm?
<el_andres96> Yeah
<Air_Rick> I don't need to go down there
<Air_Rick> unless theres something down there
<el_andres96> I went in the portal btw
<Air_Rick> oh were you saying you wanted to go check it out?
<el_andres96> Yeah
<el_andres96> wanted to see where the items go
<el_andres96> You went back in?
<Air_Rick> lag
<el_andres96> Next up is the guardian farm
<Air_Rick> I tried to go into a water temple in singleplayer and got absolutely fucked on
<el_andres96> Yeah they are pretty crazy
<Air_Rick> never seen slime blocks before
<el_andres96> We have a ton in the castle
<JavelinFury> wait el you have a new teamate?
<el_andres96> nah Egg is not new
<JavelinFury> oh its just egg
<el_andres96> I've teamed up with him since I joined the server
<Air_Rick> yeah this is my first mc account, just renamed
<JavelinFury> i didnt know that was egg ok
<el_andres96> This is the guardian farm
<Air_Rick> ohh so this is where all that water stuff came from
<Air_Rick> prismarine
<el_andres96> Yeah
<el_andres96> This is also where out fish comes from
<Air_Rick> ahhh
<el_andres96> 3 doubles chests here
<Air_Rick> holy
<Air_Rick> prismarine is beautiful
<Air_Rick> sad stuff like htis can't be easily incorporated into the old parts of the map
<el_andres96> The elevator still works
<el_andres96> look
<Air_Rick> oh dang
<Air_Rick> how does it work?
<Air_Rick> that's some black magic
<el_andres96> It was a mechanic with a fence and ice
<el_andres96> Not sure how it works
<el_andres96> Artz has made all the item elevators
<Air_Rick> that's so cool
<el_andres96> but I think it's broken all the items were falling off
<el_andres96> I want to see it again just to make sure
<Air_Rick> stuff is still being rocketed off
<Air_Rick> on that thing
<Air_Rick> yeah just got a fish from the glass
<el_andres96> Ok it's working right
<el_andres96> Then the items get dispensed and they slide to the storage chests
<el_andres96> and sorted auto
<el_andres96> Now let's go down
<Air_Rick> whats down there?
<el_andres96> The farm
<el_andres96> care not to fall
<JavelinFury> wish we could turn back time
<JavelinFury> to the good ol days
<Air_Rick> to the good old days?
<JavelinFury> when the mommas sand us to sleep but now were stressed out
<JavelinFury> sang*
<el_andres96> they sand us
<el_andres96> The sponge gets wet after use and then you dry them up again in the furnances
<JavelinFury> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXRviuL6vMY
<JavelinFury> this song is legit
<Air_Rick> oh that's new
<el_andres96> There's a ladder here to go down
<el_andres96> Ill put all these blocks upstairs
<Air_Rick> word
<el_andres96> gosh
<Air_Rick> haha
<Air_Rick> might take a bit
<el_andres96> Have you seen them yourself?
<Air_Rick> seen what?
<el_andres96> the blocks
<Air_Rick> yeah
<Air_Rick> only a little
<Air_Rick> but I love them
<Air_Rick> regular prismarine blocks most I think
<el_andres96> Yeah they look pretty good
<el_andres96> The lamps are cool too
<Air_Rick> yeah those are second in my book
<Air_Rick> what are they made out of?
<el_andres96> That's where they spawn and burn
<Air_Rick> I love how there's so much iron the blocks are used at regular building blocks
<el_andres96> hahah yeah
<el_andres96> The iron tench gave us a lifetime supply
<el_andres96> So we don't have to worry about iron anymore
<Air_Rick> I've already got near 6 stacks of blocks in my enderchest from mining over the years
<el_andres96> theres a ladder ehre too
<el_andres96> How can you keep that much
<el_andres96> My enderchest is full and I only keep 1 stack in there
<Air_Rick> I filled it up before a lot of all this new stuff came out
<Air_Rick> my other accounts don't have as much
clipchip joined the game
<el_andres96> Hmm
<Air_Rick> ?
<el_andres96> For some reason the prismarine is getting mixed up with the fish
<el_andres96> Ok that's it for this area
<el_andres96> Not sure if you already know this btw but nether roof travel is banned
<ypy> whoa^
<ypy> since when
<el_andres96> Couple of years ago it was banend
<el_andres96> in 2014 I think
<ypy> makes sense
Air_Rick joined the game
<el_andres96> You're lagging?
<Air_Rick> yes
<Air_Rick> god damn I hate nether portals
<el_andres96> Not sure how this works
<JavelinFury> clip
<Air_Rick> I remember vaguely when it was banned, but I thought a patch made it impossible to get up there?
<el_andres96> It said it was a mob arena
<clipchip> hi
<Air_Rick> for what purpose?
<el_andres96> I guess mobs fall through the roof down here
<el_andres96> and you fight them
<Air_Rick> ohh
<el_andres96> would make sense, the tower on top if a mob spawner
<el_andres96> And then it tunnels down here to storage
<el_andres96> That cut the water and closed the exits but the trap door didnt open
<Air_Rick> ah
<JavelinFury> lol
<el_andres96> oh
<el_andres96> there it is
<el_andres96> the final boss
<Air_Rick> this is an escape route thats cool
<JavelinFury> nice right?
<Air_Rick> lol
<Air_Rick> final boss
<clipchip> yes
<JavelinFury> just gotta put everything in place now
<Air_Rick> the hardest to kill for me
<JavelinFury> clip
<JavelinFury> can you get the sorting blocks and put them in over here
<el_andres96> I'm actually confused
<Air_Rick> I dislike harming my chickens
<el_andres96> There's just a capsule here
<Air_Rick> odd

<clipchip> yukar i'll fucking take down that video where it says you are my best friend
<Yukarion> lol
<morl0ck> i used to like ubuntu but it has really gotten gimmiky
<Yukarion> I personally don't like debian because it's slow to update, and I dislike the concept
<Yukarion> of unrelated people modifying the packages I'm using
<Iron_Crafter0815> hi im xPixiStar im at my cousins house
<Iron_Crafter0815> hi im xPixiStar im at my cousins house
<Yukarion> Leading to problems like this https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2008/05/random_number_b.html
<morl0ck> yeah it is hella slow to update
<clipchip> yeah I agree Yukar
<Yukarion> But I mean, it's not a bad distro
<morl0ck> you can enable the bleeding edge repos, though
<clipchip> Yukar what do you think of Gentoo
<Yukarion> I think Gentoo is cool, emerge is really cool
Maconishma joined the game
<Yukarion> I wish Arch merged pacman with ABS, to create a kind of optional emerge in Arch
<clipchip> hey mac
<Yukarion> That would make Arch pretty much the perfect distro
<Maconishma> hey clip
<clipchip> i came up with an idea for trump tower
<clipchip> we can put portals to trump city locations here
<Maconishma> that is true
<Maconishma> and nice
<clipchip> i was thinking we all build a house or something
<clipchip> these 3 will bel ike
<clipchip> uh
<clipchip> middle one to our other locations portal
<clipchip> not sure about left
<Maconishma> redo the gold farm one
<Maconishma> put it here
<clipchip> put what?
<Maconishma> put the gold farm portal here
<clipchip> what about like
<clipchip> a mob farms portal
<clipchip> right there
<Maconishma> yes
<clipchip> that goes to another room with like
<clipchip> enderman, pigman, etc
<Maconishma> we should map this out
<Maconishma> roughly
Infam0us2 joined the game
<Maconishma> Hey Nexxon_

<morl0ck> have you used a tool called driftnet
<clipchip> i'm not a script kiddie like you morl0ck
<Maconishma> Yes
<Maconishma> clipchip
<Maconishma> you said you fucking use nmap for ddos
<Yukarion> lol
<CreaPat> morlock is actually old
<Maconishma> that is the definition of script kiddie
<Maconishma> nmap is literally scripts
<clipchip> i compiled it myself though
<clipchip> pay attention kid, I said i pirated it
<Yukarion> No he didn't use nmap for DDoS, he wrote a VB GUI interface to DDoS with nmap
<Maconishma> Why waste your time on that though
<Yukarion> Because total pro hax0r
<clipchip> i took mac's advice, dropped $1000 on raspberry pi 2's
<clipchip> loaded up nmap on each of them
<Yukarion> Do you know http://hackertyper.net/
<clipchip> and i use a virtual panel type thing to make them all target the same machine
<Maconishma> You would still be limited by your own bandwidth
<Maconishma> and no
<Maconishma> you would build a cluster
<Maconishma> not virtual panel
<clipchip> whatever
<Yukarion> omg, a cPanel interface to nmap
<Yukarion> that would be hilarious
<Yukarion> Nononono
_infinityMazz joined the game
<Maconishma> I've ran shitty php scripts off cpanel before lmao
<Yukarion> I know, we should make a nmap wordpress plugin
<Maconishma> Oh my gods

<Maconishma> You can type and pretend to be a fancy haxor like clipchip
<clipchip> ha
<MFLP1998> lol
<clipchip> key word here is pretend
<Maconishma> Yes
<clipchip> you won't actually be a hacker like me
<Maconishma> No
<morl0ck> you can type "rm -rf /" like clipchip
<Yukarion> You forgot --no-preserver-root
<Maconishma> I was making the statement you pretend clip.
<clipchip> get out
<Maconishma> why don't you ddos me with your fancy nmap
<Yukarion> Guys did you all read this? https://lwn.net/Articles/675375/rss
<Maconishma> pirated*
<Yukarion> Last month somebody discovered that rm -rf / actually bricked some UEFI systems
<Maconishma> lmfao
<Yukarion> as in literally unbootable hardware
<morl0ck> try this command "perl -e "fork while fork" &
<Yukarion> perl noob
<morl0ck> lol
<Yukarion> :(){ :|:& };:
<clipchip> morl0ck doesn't even know what he's talking about
<clipchip> figures from someone who uses an ubuntu ripoff
<Yukarion> I must admit, "fork while fork" does sound pretty good
<Yukarion> Do you all know about sleep sort?
<Maconishma> ye

<lysergidi> you have to pay tax
<CreaPat> javelin said you were moving to creadise, lysi
<lysergidi> huh?
<lysergidi> idk
<lysergidi> does the portals work already
<CreaPat> I am preparing everything
<CreaPat> yes
<lysergidi> but my consentration camp is in 800k 800k
<CreaPat> yes, but they can do without you
<CreaPat> we need you here
<lysergidi> how to make portal
<CreaPat> you take 10 obsidian
<CreaPat> 3 top, 3 bottom, 2 two middle each side, leave hole in the middle
<CreaPat> then you place a lapisblock in the hole and a diamond block on top of the lapis in the hole
<lysergidi> do you have these things
<CreaPat> then you travel to your destination and build another portal
<CreaPat> I don t have enough obby
<lysergidi> hey it doesn't work because i cant die between making 2 portals
<CreaPat> but I don t think you could travel all the way from your home to here and survive
<CreaPat> yes
<lysergidi> stupid yukar
<lysergidi> change it
<lysergidi> i want to make portal, then die and go to spawn
<lysergidi> YUKAR
<lysergidi> YUAKAR
Fimoman joined the game
<lysergidi> CHANGE
<Yukarion> What?
<Fimoman> was ist das für ein server:(
<lysergidi> change how portals work
<CreaPat> hallo, fimo
<Fimoman> whi
<CreaPat> hier ist ein survival vanilla server
<Yukarion> Change them how?
<lysergidi> so i can make portal, then /kill and go to spawn and then make another portal
<CreaPat> griefen und pvp sind erlaubt, hacks nicht
<Yukarion> No
<lysergidi> why
<lysergidi> WHY
<Fimoman> WAS
<lysergidi> why did you make it like this
<Fimoman> ddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd
<lysergidi> shut up
<lysergidi> yukar
<lysergidi> why
<lysergidi> tell me
<Fimoman> ok
<lysergidi> YUKAR WHY
<lysergidi> tell me
<Fimoman> yes
<lysergidi> what
<CreaPat> fimo, kommst du klar?
<Fimoman> ja so halb
<lysergidi> Fimoman
<CreaPat> fimo is yuki
<lysergidi> no
<Yukarion> So that if people want to travel some distance, they have to actually travel it
<Yukarion> Err, so that if people want to make a portal between two places
<lysergidi> but i have already travelled
<Yukarion> they have to actually travel between those two places
<lysergidi> but why without dieing
<Yukarion> It's to make them more balanced, so people can't have long distance portals easily
<lysergidi> unban nether travel then
<clipchip> couldn't it be dying without a bed Yukar?
<Yukarion> nether travel is not banned?
<lysergidi> i mean nether top
<Yukarion> Nah, because then people travel away, build a portal, then /kill
<Yukarion> then they have a portal to their bed
<clipchip> but they could just build the first portal anyways
<clipchip> what's the problem
<Yukarion> They could, but if they don't have the foresight for that, then their problem
<lysergidi> he wont give me 800k 800k portal
<Yukarion> I'll give it to you for $1 000 000 donation
<lysergidi> 10$
<Yukarion> "donation"

<xPixiStar> I knew you didn't have any tnt
<xPixiStar> You never thought i would get a diamond sword, would you?
<xPixiStar> Host an event pls
<Yukarion> I love using axes instead of swords now
<Yukarion> Axes are awesome
<CreaPat> oh
<EggTheif> I saw they updated them
<EggTheif> whats different now?
<morl0ck> you can't put fire asp on them though
<Yukarion> That's true morl0ck
<xPixiStar> arrows also has poison
<CreaPat> are they as good as swords?
<Yukarion> Axes hit harder than swords, but can't hit as often
<Yukarion> Damage per second is still higher for swords though
<EggTheif> that's cool
<Yukarion> But axes work great with shields
<EggTheif> glad we're getting some much needed pvp updateed
<EggTheif> updates
<Yukarion> Yeah, the spam clicking was getting kind of boring
<EggTheif> yeah
<EggTheif> I wish more games had chivalry style combat
<maserati12> They gave us dual wielding
<maserati12> But you cant even hold 2 swords

<CreaPat> I want knitting needles
<ypy> boxing gloves?
<EggTheif> hold one sword > press f > hold other sword
<maserati12> Dragon tooth
<EggTheif> but cant swing both

<EggTheif> so far only shield that ive notices
<EggTheif> noticed
<EggTheif> also boats now have the wood type in their name
<Yukarion> I think you can eat food
<ypy> i've only used torches/blocks in the second hand but even that is v useful
<Yukarion> Oh you can have torches? That sounds quite useful
<voyager480> u could hold potion in offhand when in combat
<Yukarion> Do the torches light stuff up as you walk along?
<EggTheif> oh my god shields block arrows completely
<maserati12> You can have a sword and bow
<ypy> yuk - i wish
<Yukarion> Wait, you can use a sword and a bow at the same time?

<clipchip> litargirio
<Litargirio> hm
<ypy> hii
<CreaPat> oh, peppy was on!
<Litargirio> 1 sec
<clipchip> did you make it easy to harvest this farm?
<Litargirio> no i made it so it's as tough as possible
<CreaPat> lol
<clipchip> also fluz
<CreaPat> don t be fresh with clipi, liti, you know he is very strict
<Cingular_> me
<Litargirio> pah
<CreaPat> ;)
<clipchip> yea do you have those potatoes or were they at BOC
<Litargirio> stupid questions aside, yes it is easy to harvest
<CreaPat> is boc dead, now?
<Cingular_> well I saw the farm had explosions so idk why you didn't take em
<clipchip> thanks
<Litargirio> the farm is basically shaped like a funnel
<Litargirio> so all you do is release water from the edges and it harvests itself
<clipchip> yea i'm just asking because i saw the start of one of the farms you were building
<clipchip> and it looked like a massive pain in the ass to harvest
<Litargirio> which one?
<Cingular_> 15 minutes you could replant the entire thing
<clipchip> the one with the water wall or something
<Cingular_> water wall?
<Litargirio> that's not the start of a farm, that was THE farm
<clipchip> oh, huh
<Cingular_> oh the one by my house?
<clipchip> no i'm talking to litargirio fluz
<clipchip> when i was at your farm fluz i couldn't find any baked potatoes
<Cingular_> oh
<CreaPat> wow, liti!
<Litargirio> ikr
<CreaPat> wowowowowowow
<Cingular_> well yall missed the huge chest room right by it , the road had paths leading to itand all
<Litargirio> wait stop
<CreaPat> you always want to replant these yourself?
<Litargirio> when you walk around, don't drop off the edges of the dirt blocks, use the slabs to descend
<CreaPat> of course
<Litargirio> well, automatic replanting is not a thing yet, so yes, of course it will be replanted by hand
<CreaPat> did clipi see it?
<clipchip> yes it is litargirio
<Litargirio> no
<clipchip> you can use villagers
<clipchip> to auto replant
<Cingular_> slavery ftw
<CreaPat> but they also harvest
<CreaPat> anyway. I think he will have villies here sooner or later
<Litargirio> clipi didn't see it because otherwise he wouldn't be saying bullshit
<Litargirio> i mean nonsense sorry
<CreaPat> clipi, why don t you come for a visit?
<Litargirio> villager replanting works when the farm is 20 x 20 blocks
<Litargirio> this farm is 20 x 20 chunks
<CreaPat> it does remind me of verdun though
<Litargirio> villagers don't replant 20 x 20 chunks, dear clipi
<CreaPat> make fences around their heads
<clipchip> can't you just add more villagers per 20x20 area?
<Litargirio> no?
<CreaPat> divide the fields in smaller parts and put two villies per section
<Litargirio> let me see...
<CreaPat> clipi, are you coming?
<CreaPat> sunrise!!
<clipchip> in a couple minutes crea
<Cingular_> plains biome surrounded by jungle... what an interesting view
<CreaPat> ok
<Litargirio> i am going to make a rough estimate here
<CreaPat> nice
<Litargirio> but i'd need a few hundred villagers for this entire thing
<Litargirio> it'd be a nightmare
<clipchip> sounds like replanting it yourself already is
<CreaPat> why?
<Litargirio> it's way easier to replant by hant
<CreaPat> well

<JavelinFury> because its sucken into the ground by one
<JavelinFury> so it needs to go up one block to adjust
<clipchip> uh
<clipchip> so it's wrong if it's copied exactly from creative?
<JavelinFury> just make it 1 block taller
<JavelinFury> and just for the sandstone place
<clipchip> oh
<clipchip> i see
<JavelinFury> since the outside is 1 block higher then the inside
<JavelinFury> k
<clipchip> yea this works
<clipchip> do we have any more sandstone here?
<JavelinFury> doubt it
<clipchip> there's a bunch in the vault
<JavelinFury> are you going to the vault?
<JavelinFury> or did you already go

<worldruler086> it has turqoise blocks
<worldruler086> other than that no idea
<worldruler086> I was able to dig underneath the blocks to the southwest corner tower
<worldruler086> but Im not going to bother finding the layout when I have more to dig
<ostrich1414> Yeah I gotcha
<worldruler086> and the problem with coming up with decoration ideas is I have no idea what I'm modifying
<worldruler086> but I'm definitely making avenues
<ostrich1414> Yeah, for that part we may need to get some of the people who were here before, like pip probably
<worldruler086> yeah, plus I want to know what each building was suppose to do
<worldruler086> there's a hotel thing, the rest are empty or destroyed
<worldruler086> need any cobble? :)
<ostrich1414> I wasn't even here when the city was at its peak, I only remember the early version of the city

<ostrich1414> Ooh that's cool, have any screenshots?
<ypy> i'll take some in a bit yea
<ostrich1414> Cool, I'm excited to see man
<ypy> yo totally unrelated but i saw on the wiki you live in ma? i grew up there haha. high five
<ostrich1414> Oh shit yooo you did? What part of Mass?
<ostrich1414> Proud Masshole right here
<ostrich1414> Great area
<ostrich1414> I'm from Chelsea, MA, which is an absolutely disgusting city lol
<ostrich1414> I grew up in the inner city
<ypy> oh haha yep. never spent much time there but ive heard plenty of stories
<ostrich1414> Yeah, I mean I love Boston and the Greater Boston area, but Chelsea is just a shithole lol
<ostrich1414> Especially with the whole opioid epidemic up here
<ypy> i feel like every small town in new england is getting fucked by that. ive lost so many high school friends and shit. its no joke
<ostrich1414> Same, just three months ago a good friend of mine overdosed
<ostrich1414> It's so fuked up
<ostrich1414> Especially in cities in Mass
<ostrich1414> I have a friend from Lowell who was also killed two years ago
<ostrich1414> Lol I apologize for bringing up such a depressing topic on fucking Minecraft
<ypy> haha dude no worries. i agree though. its serious shit
<ypy> i live in SF now which has ~ plenty ~ of its own problems
<ostrich1414> *cough* liberals *cough*
<ostrich1414> By the way, I'm a black conservative
<ostrich1414> Just so you know lmao
<ostrich1414> A rare species
<ypy> thats a rare sight
<ostrich1414> I take pride in my uniqueness
<ostrich1414> Lol what made you move out to San Fran anyways?
<ypy> work work work work work
<ypy> this is where the tech money is
<ostrich1414> Oh damn you in the tech biz?
<ostrich1414> Nice
<ypy> yee
<ostrich1414> It aint cheap to live in San Fran either
<ypy> its really not.. one of those many things wrong with it for sure
<ostrich1414> Same with Boston, even shitty apartments are on the rise
<ostrich1414> Pretty much every major city in the US
<ostrich1414> But San Fran is one of the worst I've heard
<ypy> its flattening out a bit but its still crazy. i think average price for a 1 bedroom is $3200 or something
<ostrich1414> Holy fuck
<ostrich1414> "Average"
<ostrich1414> Damn
<ypy> "As of June 2017, average rent for an apartment in San Francisco, CA is $3803 "
<ypy> fml
<ostrich1414> Fuck dude, good luck
<ostrich1414> R.I.P.
<ostrich1414> I'm going into my junior year of college this semester, but once I graduate I have no idea where to go next lol
<ostrich1414> Shit's gonna cost so much moeny in two years
<ostrich1414> *money
<ypy> yeah i feel like every major city in the US is getting wicked expensive
<ypy> idk man, i'm gonna save up some money then go live on a beach in balior some shit
<ostrich1414> I've been looking at apartments in like Dorchester and Roxbury but even those neighborhoods are expensive now
<ypy> bali or*
<ostrich1414> Lol that sounds dope
<ostrich1414> I wish
<ypy> i lived in mission hill right next to roxbury for a bit
<ypy> it was not cheap. and that was like 4 or 5 years ago
<ostrich1414> Yeah lol, and Roxbury isn't even a very good neighborhood
<ypy> i imagine roxbury itself is a bit better but yeah. its all yp there
<ostrich1414> I found a very cheap apartment in Lawrence so I may move there after college and commute to Boston, the only problem is it's in Lawrence lmao
<ostrich1414> But damn it was cheap
<ostrich1414> And spacious
<ypy> my parents just gave up and moved to maine actually
<ostrich1414> Lol what part?
<ypy> stepdaad still commutes into boston
<ypy> right on the border, kittery
<ostrich1414> Nice, I like Kittery
<ypy> cant remember if i've been but looking forward to visiting. sounds pretty chill
<ostrich1414> I've been like twice, I like it up there

<J3rmin8or> i knew about the enderpearl trick
<wilrichards1> ^
<wilrichards1> nerfed unfortunately
<ypy> whats the enderpearl trick
<wilrichards1> get ontop of the nether
<J3rmin8or> for getting onto the roof of the nether
<ypy> oh to get on the nether roof?
<J3rmin8or> yea
<ypy> yeah that hasnt worked in forever
<JavelinFury> XD
<JavelinFury> there are other ways
<ypy> those were the good ol days
<ypy> o rly jav
<J3rmin8or> yup lol
<wilrichards1> you can use a trap door
<JavelinFury> there are like 3 ways i know how
<J3rmin8or> oh really?
<wilrichards1> yea
<JavelinFury> but yukar just F'ed it all up
<J3rmin8or> lel
<J3rmin8or> what happened?
<JavelinFury> he made it so if you go above the nether roof at all
<JavelinFury> you teleport down to the next level below
<wilrichards1> close a trap door while enclosed in the highest point, log off then log back in and end on the roof
<J3rmin8or> wtf
<J3rmin8or> that sucks
<ypy> more fun without it i think
<J3rmin8or> i mean....it works in vanilla, doesn't it?
<ypy> more of a challenge
<J3rmin8or> i don't mind
<J3rmin8or> i'm pretty experienced in distance traveling at this piont
<J3rmin8or> point*
<wilrichards1> its not like u cant go to the highest point of the nether and build a highway like apparently someone has done xD
<J3rmin8or> yea
<J3rmin8or> that's what someone else told me
<JavelinFury> what?
<wilrichards1> reason why i dont use nether is bc i dont want them to find my door lol
<JavelinFury> noone did that
<J3rmin8or> oh
<J3rmin8or> nvm. i'm thinking of a different server i was recently on
<JavelinFury> someone built it at the lowest point but not at the highest
<J3rmin8or> it kinda sucked, tho
<wilrichards1> lowest or highest
<wilrichards1> either or
<J3rmin8or> hm
<J3rmin8or> seems like it would take a while, but i guess not
<J3rmin8or> especially if you have admin power
<JavelinFury> well i mean
<JavelinFury> this server is 6 years old
<JavelinFury> plus an admin didnt build the nether highway
<JavelinFury> suit1337 did
<ypy> yeah nothing on the map was made with admin powers J3rmin8or
<wilrichards1> yea its not too bad just takes time
<ypy> except spawn
<J3rmin8or> oh, sweet
<J3rmin8or> that's cool
<J3rmin8or> i like building big stuff in vanilla survival mode

<JCTSteve> I wonder why
<JCTSteve> idk
<JCTSteve> maybe
<JCTSteve> or maybe not
<ostrich1414> Lmao bruh I'm intrigued now
<ostrich1414> Is this a new name?
<JCTSteve> no
<JCTSteve> I had this name
<JCTSteve> for the whole time
<ostrich1414> Yeah your name seems familiar
<JCTSteve> does the word "jail" ring a bell
<ostrich1414> Not really, so many people have been jailed on here
<JCTSteve> and never join again
<JCTSteve> but I'm not them
<ostrich1414> Are you still in jail right now?
<JCTSteve> well
<JCTSteve> what do you expect
<JCTSteve> yes
<ostrich1414> Well I wasn't sure because you can appeal on the forum and some people have gotten unjailed
<JCTSteve> really?
<JCTSteve> like
<JCTSteve> I have been jailed
<JCTSteve> for about
<JCTSteve> a long time
<JCTSteve> idk when

<JCTSteve> which world?
<JCTSteve> I'll never do anything to harm
<ostrich1414> What do you mean which world? There's only one
<JCTSteve> there is
<JCTSteve> ./world
<ostrich1414> Well yeah bu tyou'd have to be an idiot to make a base in /world
<JCTSteve> or is that gone
<JCTSteve> I see
<ostrich1414> It's a condensed pvp arena
<JCTSteve> so
<JCTSteve> coords plz
<JCTSteve> I wanna watch
<ostrich1414> Lol nigga I ain't giving you shit
<JCTSteve> why not
<JCTSteve> I never hack people
<JCTSteve> I only
<JCTSteve> like using skills
<ostrich1414> I don't know you, I don't trust you, and I don't need you knowing them
<JCTSteve> say
<JCTSteve> does owner come on
<JCTSteve> or an admin
<ostrich1414> Every now and then, yes
<JCTSteve> I'm kinda bored with this ugly spawn now lol
<JCTSteve> I see
<JCTSteve> but
<JCTSteve> there's nothing interesting in this spawn
<ostrich1414> Yeah, spawn sucks
<JCTSteve> do people here know how to build
<ostrich1414> Yeah, but since it's a pvp world, spawn has been destroyed by griefers
<ostrich1414> The further out you go, the nicer it is
<JCTSteve> hmmm
<JCTSteve> how far do you have to go out
<JCTSteve> never been so far
<ostrich1414> Once you get at least 3-4k out, the terrain becomes normal again. But if you go much further out, it's prcatically untouched
<JCTSteve> I see
<ostrich1414> But of course you can find old bases and cities and castles lying around
<JCTSteve> I should
<JCTSteve> make an alt
<JCTSteve> and play
<JCTSteve> I know from fact I won't be out of jail
<ostrich1414> Yeah you could probably just make an alt to play

<Master_Xybot> me too
<worldruler086> I've been trying to do indoors the day between
<worldruler086> of course this is more a "ought to" rather than "to do"
<worldruler086> anywho, this building appears to be mostly untouched outside, minus the roof
<worldruler086> but the inside is flooded
<worldruler086> it had a lot of savanna wood to block the water
<worldruler086> that all burned
ostrich1414 left the game
ostrich1414 joined the game
<ostrich1414> That was annoying, my game crashed
<ostrich1414> But yeah, anything made of wood is fucked
<worldruler086> yeah, it'll be hard to interpret where it exactly was
<worldruler086> unless it wasn't a complete burn
<ypy> wtf
<ypy> whenever i hit a powered rail the cart throws me out
<ypy> what am i doing wrong
<Master_Xybot> the powered rail isn't powered
<ostrich1414> That's weird, that's never happened to me
<ostrich1414> Must be a glitch
<ypy> its totally powered
<worldruler086> never had it throw me out
<Master_Xybot> huh
<Master_Xybot> that's what it does if it's not powered

<ypy> yeah you
<ypy> lil birdie told me you're the master of chest organization
<ypy> i need help
<ypy> mine are a mess
<clipchip> what
<ypy> how should i arrange them
<clipchip> i really want to know who said that
<ypy> sekrit
<ostrich1414> I'm that little birdie ;)
<clipchip> oh
<worldruler086> heh, ostrichs are birds
<Master_Xybot> oh clip, I automated the melon fram
<ostrich1414> NIGGA I'LL RAPE YOu
<Master_Xybot> farm
<ostrich1414> LOl
<worldruler086> D:
<ostrich1414> Whoops
<ostrich1414> Caps lock :/
<clipchip> yea i really don't organize my chests
<ypy> wtf ostrich
<clipchip> i just throw things into a chest until i need to craft a new one
<ypy> :(
<clipchip> javelin and me built a big auto sorter for every item in the game though
<Master_Xybot> oh sweet
<ypy> ok thats what im talking about
<ypy> how
<clipchip> uh
<clipchip> i can build up a little one in /world
<clipchip> if you want to see
<ypy> very yes
<ostrich1414> Yeah that's what I was referencing, the auto sorter
<clipchip> ok come to 0,0
<ypy> omw
<clipchip> ok done
<clipchip> so imagine this is the input chest up here
<ypy> woops
<ypy> kk
<ypy> the top one?
<clipchip> yeah
<clipchip> you put all your items in there
<clipchip> the hopper with the comparator on the side is basically what selects each item
<clipchip> it needs 4 junk items that you won't ever sort
<clipchip> so a good thing for that is like renamed cobblestone
<clipchip> then 41 of the item
<ypy> why 41
<clipchip> it's just enough so when it hits 42 it makes the signal 1 longer
<clipchip> letting it pass into the bottom chest
<clipchip> here check it out
<ypy> dude this is sick
<clipchip> if you put in something else it'll just keep going by
<clipchip> into the next hopper
<ypy> this third hopper up here isnt used is it?
<clipchip> it's where all the items that aren't sorted go
<ypy> oooh
<clipchip> so you can build a copy of the one sorter right beside it
<clipchip> it's stackable
<ypy> so you would have that pipe into the next one
<ypy> yeah
<ypy> damn son
<clipchip> the way the redstone is set up you don't even need a 1 block space inbetween or anything
<clipchip> so it'd just go like that again
<ypy> even with the redstone connected like that?
<clipchip> yeah
<ypy> huh
<ypy> ok i'll take your word for it haha
<clipchip> the signal strength only ever gets 1 more
<ypy> this is sick
<clipchip> so it can't do a diagnal and cross over
<ypy> right
<clipchip> it's a bit faster if you remove the top hoppers and use ice also
<ypy> how would that work
<clipchip> imagine the orange stuff is ice
<clipchip> and those cobble blocks are a chest
<clipchip> if you put a water stream here it'll slide into the chests
<ypy> oooh
<clipchip> and angle up so it can go in the hopper
<clipchip> while sliding at ice speed
<ypy> word
<ypy> sweet well i gotta bounce but thanks for showing me
<ypy> im gonna build this
<clipchip> np
<clipchip> you want me to keep this here?
<ypy> up to you. i got tons of screenshots and stuff
<clipchip> alright ill take it apart then
<clipchip> could always use extra hoppers
<clipchip> it's better to use packed ice also
<clipchip> i think the redstone light might melt normal ice
<clipchip> idk

<worldruler086> yeah, only minor block lag
<worldruler086> but I'm mining a lot, so that's expected
<Ultra_Badass> and the surge protector is plugged into a defective wall outlet
<Ultra_Badass> so my suspicion is that there's some power problem

<ostrich1414> Yeah no problem
<clipchip> well if you need any material for that just ask
<clipchip> i feel like it would come out kind of biased if i wrote it myself
<ostrich1414> By the way, ypy is working on a place called The Tomb, but at first he called it The Vault since he didn't know you and Jav already had that name for yours, so now there is a wiki page with the title The Vault
<ostrich1414> Want me to work on that one also?

<ypy> thanks!
<ostrich1414> No prob
<clipchip> bbl
clipchip left the game
<ypy> so i need ideas for what to do with the upstairs bits
<ostrich1414> Like for rooms?
<ypy> yeah just how the rooms are laid out
<ypy> i want it to feel palatial
<ostrich1414> Hmm
<ostrich1414> I have two ideas
<ostrich1414> One is just leaving this as one giant room, a spacious room with whatever you need in it, it could look cool
<ostrich1414> The second is making four big rooms, like each corner is a room and they meet in the middle
<ostrich1414> Not sure how else though
<ypy> one thing i was thinking is making it kind of tiered
<ypy> so obviously i started filling in that floor we were just on
<ypy> but now i'm thinking maybe rip out the middle bit and have it be like layered going up and a floating room in the middle
<ypy> so imagine this wall goes up another 5 blocks or so
<ostrich1414> Yeah that could be cool
<ostrich1414> By the way, is this The Tomb's official flag?
<ypy> and the have bridges out into ~ something ~ in the middle
<ypy> for now yeah
<ostrich1414> Yeah I like that idea
<ostrich1414> Can I take a copy? I have a banner museum in Quinsigamond
<ypy> of course
<ostrich1414> Sweet, thanks
<ypy> wait which one
<ypy> i have some old ones in those chests
<ypy> i think thats it yeah
<ypy> whatevers flying on the top floor
<ostrich1414> Okay, cool
<ypy> yeah that's it
<ostrich1414> Sweet
<ostrich1414> Do you have black wool anywhere?
<ypy> err probably not
<ypy> ./world does tho :P
<ostrich1414> True lol, forgot
<ostrich1414> This is the UA's official flag
<ypy> oh nice
<ostrich1414> I'm just giving you a copy so you have it
<ypy> awesome
<ostrich1414> Feel free to place that wherever as well if you want

<ostrich1414> Hey ypy
<ypy> woo
<ypy> full house
<ypy> hey
<ypy> clip i thought about you earlier
<clipchip> i've been thinking about you all day too <3
<ypy> i was eating some chips...
<ypy> and it was a pretty big bag
<ypy> and i was like 'hm ok i should not finish these that would be gross'
<ypy> how should i seal this bag
<ypy> if only i had.... a clip chip
<ypy> chip clip
<clipchip> have you met chipclip yet?
<ypy> i wish
<clipchip> she's real
worldruler086 left the game
<clipchip> i should get her to come on here again sometime
<clipchip> damn she's not on skype right now
<ypy> that's incredible tho
<ostrich1414> Lol
<Master_Xybot> fucking ghosts man
<ostrich1414> I mean I know the first few portals but you hve to take a series of like 8 portals to get there lol, and the las few are really hidden
<ypy> where is this
<clipchip> xd
<clipchip> i was just asking if your place was connected up to monarchia
<ostrich1414> Lol I was talking about Candyland
<ostrich1414> Yeah you have to go to Qunisigamond
<ostrich1414> Then there's a bunch of portals you have to take
<ostrich1414> Eventually it brings you there, I just forget the exact rout
<ostrich1414> *route
<ypy> hey btw ostrich cool if i get rid of my straight-to-spawn portal
<ypy> and make a more difficult to discover one
<ostrich1414> Oh yeah, go for it. I would just ask Jav first though so he can help make one hidden that him/I/clip can go to as well if we need to give you stuff
<ostrich1414> And probably to hide it and make it one-way
<ypy> how can a portal be one way?
<ypy> but yeah i'll coordinate w him for sure
<ostrich1414> No idea, I know Jav knows
<ostrich1414> He makes all my portals for me lol
<ostrich1414> He's my slave
<ypy> sounds like a pretty good setup

<clipchip> uh
<clipchip> i didn't think i would make it this far
<JavelinFury> crap i misse d apart shaving one sec
<ypy> you should look into improv classes
<clipchip> i was thinking about "clipii's gaze"
<dariepearjuicy> jav you must have a large and manly beard then dont even notice when you miss some of those pesky facial hairs
<clipchip> because i'll be like seeing everything going on in the server with my secret network of gang members
<clipchip> but also
<clipchip> it sounds like gays if you say it out loud
<clipchip> clipii's gays
<ypy> love it
<clipchip> so darie, want to join clipii's gaze?
<JavelinFury> XXD
<dariepearjuicy> no
<clipchip> what the hell man
<JavelinFury> darie
<dariepearjuicy> hahaah
<JavelinFury> is it 100% beause of the name
<JavelinFury> ??
<ypy> alright im afk starting now. if i die you should laugh at me
<dariepearjuicy> k
<dariepearjuicy> ugh creepers legit everywhere rn
<JavelinFury> darie
<dariepearjuicy> yes?
<JavelinFury> is the reason that you wont join clips team because of the name?
<dariepearjuicy> im my own team
<clipchip> darie is homophobic
<JavelinFury> . . .
<dariepearjuicy> yep
<dariepearjuicy> you got me
<clipchip> darie can't stand our gay relationship jav
<JavelinFury> wait what
<clipchip> yea i know it's pretty hard to believe
<dariepearjuicy> jav your like junior rn or charlie
<clipchip> i mean it's 2017 after all am i right
<JavelinFury> charlie 100%
<dariepearjuicy> XD
<JavelinFury> oh my gosh
<JavelinFury> i think my brother and his husband are gay
<dariepearjuicy> that was great
<JavelinFury> clip
<dariepearjuicy> haha
<clipchip> yeah?
<JavelinFury> you should watch black-ish
<JavelinFury> best show ever
<dariepearjuicy> amazing/10
<clipchip> too black sounding for me
<JavelinFury> where would you rather get shot?
<JavelinFury> "for someone whos been shot both places, head"
<dariepearjuicy> how you changing the < to * ?
<JavelinFury> ./me
<JavelinFury> hey clip
<JavelinFury> we should build a thing right here
<clipchip> ?
<JavelinFury> im at the golden sun
<JavelinFury> like a light house
<clipchip> yea good idea
<JavelinFury> probably circular?
<JavelinFury> maybe we just build the big square towers right here
<JavelinFury> and then like a wall that kinda goes in and connecgts to that tower right there
<JavelinFury> what do you think?
<clipchip> that sounds like a lot of work
<dariepearjuicy> i think it suz
<clipchip> i think we should wait a while
<clipchip> before doing anything
<JavelinFury> what do you think a while is
<JavelinFury> 1 day
<JavelinFury> 2 days
<JavelinFury> indefinitly?
<clipchip> something like that yeah
<JavelinFury> get bakc her
<JavelinFury> but do you think that would be a good idea?
<clipchip> i think just a normal lighthouse would probably be easier to get looking good
<clipchip> we'd need to do something with this river area
<JavelinFury> hrmmm
<JavelinFury> true
<JavelinFury> k
<JavelinFury> well
<dariepearjuicy> just found the best mine ever
<JavelinFury> clip
<JavelinFury> what are the biomes that silverfish spawn in
<clipchip> extreme hills
<JavelinFury> isnt it also dark oak woods and roofed forest?
<clipchip> idk
<clipchip> i don't think so
<JavelinFury> oh ok
<clipchip> how come?
<JavelinFury> darie was wondering
<JavelinFury> darie you can speak in regular chat
<JavelinFury> just dont say any coords
<dariepearjuicy> aremt they near fortresses too?
<JavelinFury> there are no end fortresses on this server
<dariepearjuicy> how do you get there then?
<clipchip> yukar made an end portal
<JavelinFury> theres 1 end portal that the admins move around sometimes
<clipchip> since the map was all generated before they were added
<dariepearjuicy> wow this must be old
<dariepearjuicy> can you grow trees underground?
<clipchip> yeah
<clipchip> you need light for it though
<dariepearjuicy> torches
<dariepearjuicy> how much space do they need?
<clipchip> i think at least a 5x5 area around the sapling
<clipchip> and like 8 high?
<clipchip> maybe
<clipchip> maybe higher
<JavelinFury> i think at least 5x5 probably 11x11 tho
<dariepearjuicy> ok ill just leave this sapling alone for a while
<JavelinFury> well i have to sleep
<JavelinFury> i have to sleep
<dariepearjuicy> thats propanly smart
<JavelinFury> hve to sleep
<JavelinFury> sleep
<dariepearjuicy> stayed up till 230 last night lol
<dariepearjuicy> probably wont do that again
<dariepearjuicy> maybe
<clipchip> casuals
<dariepearjuicy> for now
<clipchip> the trick to success is going to sleep at 8:00 am
<JavelinFury> to sleep
<dariepearjuicy> im just casually tryn not to die

<ostrich1414> Sounds good
<Master_Xybot> yeah, I thought we could have a dock
<Master_Xybot> so that will lead to some room in the underground part of the central structure

<Master_Xybot> grass is to allow water to be placed properly
<ostrich1414> Ah okay

Z33VN joined the game
<ypy> oh fuck
<ypy> nooo
<ypy> it took my damn armor
<ypy> and elytra
<Yukarion> Bad husk
<Yukarion> I don't really understand most of the new mobs, honestly
<Yukarion> That goes for passive and hostile mobs
<Z33VN> A husk is one of those desert zombies right?
<Yukarion> sounds right
<ypy> yeah it is
<Z33VN> What's difficult to understand about it though?
<Yukarion> They all do different stuff
<Yukarion> and the reason for adding them in the first place
<Z33VN> I'm pretty sure a husk gives you hunger when it hits you.
<Z33VN> I forget what effect strays give.
<ypy> i might be imagining it but seems like husks can see you from way further away
<ypy> which is annoying if true
<Z33VN> Zombies can see you from pretty far though.
<Z33VN> Do you think player attributes would be something good to add?
<Yukarion> Player attributes?
<Z33VN> Yeah like attributes get higher when you use them more
<Yukarion> Like McMMO?
<Yukarion> No, I don't think that's a good idea
<Yukarion> would simply add more grinding to the game
<Z33VN> Like if you do a lot of sprinting your pace stat would go up.
<Z33VN> And fighting your strength would go up.
<Z33VN> Kind of like FIFA Pro Clubs
<Z33VN> If any of you play FIFA
<ypy> i'm very glad that minecraft doesnt have anything like that tbh
<Z33VN> I was just thinking about it.
<ypy> getting better items in survival is kind of equivalent to grinding for stats like that
<ypy> except way more interesting and rewarding
<Z33VN> Yeah I guess
<ypy> lol my laptop fan cuts out every time i press the w key
<ypy> thats a bit scary
<Z33VN> That's weird
<Yukarion> lol
<Z33VN> What's the difference between Frost Walker and Frost Walker 2?
<ypy> bigger ice patch maybe? just a guess
<Z33VN> I have 2
<ypy> "any still water blocks with air above within a radius of 2 + Level around the block being moved to will be turned into frosted ice."
<ypy> there ya go
<Z33VN> What does 1 do?
<Yukarion> "radius of 2 + Level"
<ypy> the ice is "2 + level" radius, so frost walker 1 would make a 3 radius circe
<ypy> yea
<Z33VN> ok
<Z33VN> Yukar
<Z33VN> I have a question for you
<Yukarion> Ok

<dariepearjuicy> HEY SERVER WHY ULTRA BEING DISCONNECTED?!?
<Fluz43> not to say i wana disconnect from the world but i do want to just not live in such a fast-paced environment
<dariepearjuicy> hadnt really thought of it that way
<ypy> yo, same here
<Fluz43> its probably the cbd or something
<ypy> the city is literally killing me
<Fluz43> wait a minute
<dariepearjuicy> world where everyone's tryna get ahead of one another
<Fluz43> you're not 2py
<Fluz43> ?
<ypy> 2py is robot me
<Fluz43> oooooooooooo
<Fluz43> i thought it couldn't just be a coincidence
<ypy> hahaha
<ypy> no
<ypy> anyway sorry to interrupt yall conversation about life
<Fluz43> idk where i'd want to live though
<Fluz43> you're fine haha
<Fluz43> i'm just glad I'm socializing
<Fluz43> went from like 90 to 0 when i moved home from illinois
<dariepearjuicy> haha yeah
<ypy> all i want is a place with good jobs, beautiful nature, young people, lots of cheap land, and 4 seasons
<ypy> is that really so much to ask? :P
<Fluz43> what do you define as 4 seasons
<ypy> well
TheUltraOrc left the game
<Fluz43> since people say georgia doesn't have 4 seasons but i reckon it does
<ypy> idk about georgia, never been
<ypy> i grew up in new england
<ypy> hot summers, feet of snow in the winters
<Fluz43> new england i have a weird liking to
<ypy> and the most magical fall in the world
<Fluz43> east coast i love even though i've never been to west coast
<ypy> and now i live in california and the weather never changes
<ypy> you lose something intangible... like a sense of the passage of time
<ypy> idk
<Fluz43> if i could have snow and never rain but it still got warm that's my optimal shit
<Fluz43> interesting
<Fluz43> what job do you have if you don't mimnd me asking
<ypy> i do computers
<Fluz43> i'm rebeginning a job and starting a new one very soon
<Fluz43> IT or like the person you see at high schools or so
<ypy> ha uhh neither really.. i run a little company. we're not primarily a software company but we build a lot of software
<Fluz43> oh so it involves programming and maybe languages
<dariepearjuicy> you do any hardware stuff?
<Fluz43> yknow that doesn't sound too bad if the coding wasn't so uniform and nonhuman
<Fluz43> but there's beauty w/i that in its own respect
<ypy> what i like about my gig is that the programming comes second to the human stuff
<Fluz43> what do you mean
<ypy> dariepearjuicy i have done hardware stuff in the past but not recently
<ypy> well i mean i spent a lot of time thinking/talking/planning/meeting people/etc
<ypy> i mean i still write a lot of code
<dariepearjuicy> nice. recently built a computer for my parents and was actually pretty fun
<ypy> and i get what you mean about the robotic aspect of that
<Fluz43> oh programming is second nature you mean
<ypy> but like, i think building software really comes down to people a lot of the time
<ypy> like, working with people to figure out what you're building, why, how
<ypy> and i get a kick out of that stuff and i'm glad i get to do lots of it
<ypy> and less actual writing code
<dariepearjuicy> c++ is crazy sensitive to everything. one miss placed symbol and it just error
<Fluz43> see me i enjoy more of creating in the physical world not software world
<Fluz43> i should consider seriously a carpentry
<Fluz43> -related job
<Fluz43> "one carpentry coming right up"
<Fluz43> thank goodness i found myself a connection
<ypy> i mean jesus was a carpenter
<ypy> so you got that going
<Fluz43> haha
<Fluz43> you know before i lost my faith i wanted to become a preist
<dariepearjuicy> yeah. same. im pretty good at putting little things together and can see where they go and fail and stuff
<ypy> finally found a jungle after almost 10k of walking
<Fluz43> nice
<Fluz43> set bed or /portal
<ypy> yeah was trying to find one to hook up a portal to
<ypy> so getting back is easy :)
<Fluz43> awesome
<dariepearjuicy> ypy you gonna build a tree house fortress?
<Fluz43> worst case scenario 4 minute nether walk w right gears
<ypy> darie i was thinking about it yeah
<ypy> ti tried in the past and it came out shitty tho
<ypy> so gonna play in creative a bit first
<Fluz43> i'm one of the rare few who has very little fear of public speaking
<Fluz43> tree house fortress oooooh
<dariepearjuicy> that would be cool. i watched a YouTuber who made something like that and it was dope. had bridges across and cool stuff like that
<Fluz43> like that starwars setting
<dariepearjuicy> well fluz thats something the rest of the not rare few envy lol
<Fluz43> i forget the movie number
<Fluz43> all it was for me was learning simple speaking techniques and since i have add i use the add to ignore the audience and focus on the speaking part only
<dariepearjuicy> ahh nice

<Yukarion> A staircase?
<Yukarion> I know how to do it vertically
<ypy> not steps, just 1 down 1 across blocks
<ypy> following a minecart track
<ypy> i guess i could do a vertical bit and then go straight across
<ypy> that would work too
<dariepearjuicy> hey back from afk
<dariepearjuicy> yo miz i made some progress on the farm

<clipchip> i'm getting mixed messages here

<ostrich1414> SmutPvP

<KellyEKelly> relationships are all about figuring out what the girl means
<dariepearjuicy> chat opacity=0%
<ostrich1414> Yeah clip, don't you know that girl's have no concept of the English language?
<ostrich1414> Yes means no, no means yes
<KellyEKelly> passive aggression

<ypy> you're pregnant?
<dariepearjuicy> i dont like mining netherrack anymore
<JavelinFury> XD
<JavelinFury> hey man
<JavelinFury> ill buy it from you
<dariepearjuicy> hey
<dariepearjuicy> ill take that up
<dariepearjuicy> name an amount
<dariepearjuicy> i got it
<dariepearjuicy> probably
<JavelinFury> what do you need first of all
<dariepearjuicy> hmmm
<dariepearjuicy> mining lol
<dariepearjuicy> ice maybe
<ypy> damn this tree just got hit by lightning right in front of me
<ypy> never saw that before
<JavelinFury> lol
<dariepearjuicy> dang
<JavelinFury> what kind of ice?
<dariepearjuicy> oh not packed
<dariepearjuicy> i probably have close to 100,000 blocks of netherrack
<ypy> holy shit dude
<JavelinFury> dang
<ypy> how/why
<JavelinFury> i cant think of anything to do with netherrack
<dariepearjuicy> gold farm
<dariepearjuicy> clearing
<JavelinFury> how much ice did you need?
<dariepearjuicy> 57 times 4
<JavelinFury> 4 stacks about
<dariepearjuicy> yeah
<JavelinFury> hrmm
<JavelinFury> next time im at your base ill drop off the ice
<JavelinFury> ill take like 1-2 shulkerboxes of netherrack if thats aiight with you
<dariepearjuicy> what you think about equivelnces?
<JavelinFury> no clue
<JavelinFury> im bad at tradeing
<JavelinFury> i usually leave it to other people
<dariepearjuicy> netherrack is probably cheaper than dirt
<dariepearjuicy> but takes a lot of diamond pickaxes to mine
<dariepearjuicy> i donno
<ypy> does your popularity get reset when you die?
<ypy> in a village i mean
<JavelinFury> popularity?
<ypy> b/c i have killed so many of these guys but seems random whether or not the golem attacks
<JavelinFury> oh
<JavelinFury> if you hit golem
<JavelinFury> it will attack you
<JavelinFury> thats about all i think it works
<ypy> if you hit a villager it attacks you too
<ypy> just not sure when it stops
<JavelinFury> huh
<ypy> https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Village#Popularity
<JavelinFury> didnt know that
<JavelinFury> ill just kill that iron golem in there
<dariepearjuicy> i remember populairty or reading about that
<dariepearjuicy> dont know much tho
<dariepearjuicy> i know you shouldnt hit villiagers
<dariepearjuicy> skeleton just spawned with diamond armor
<ypy> wow
<dariepearjuicy> second time ive seen it
<dariepearjuicy> and ive been seeing lots with the spawner
<dariepearjuicy> you think itll drop?
<ypy> i've definitely never had diamond armor drop from my zombie spawner
<ypy> so idk
<JavelinFury> ummm you have any lily pads?
<dariepearjuicy> nothing
<ypy> nah jav sorry
<JavelinFury> dang kk i can make this work
<ypy> theres a swamp through the portal on the right though
<JavelinFury> thanks
<dariepearjuicy> oh ypy about the mob cap situation. i think for some reason when 2py is on doing farming it affects my slime farm and makes it so little to none spawn
<ypy> yeah darie i stopped farming after you told me that
<ypy> so anything since then isnt me
<dariepearjuicy> i got slimes spawning when everyone was off the server
<ypy> ive only farmed for a few minutes at a time to repair stuff
<dariepearjuicy> i dont know whats happening
<dariepearjuicy> so weird
<dariepearjuicy> hey jav what was the reason that the extreme hills cut off to ocean the way it does at my base
<JavelinFury> chunk errors
<dariepearjuicy> do you think that somehow that might be affecting my slime spawn rate
<dariepearjuicy> i wish one players mob count didnt affect anothers. i guess thats for server lag stuff, but still. wish it was more isolated
Fluz43 joined the game
<ypy> shit
<ypy> oh nope it's all good

<ypy> where are the doors
<JavelinFury> underneath
<ypy> ah nice
<JavelinFury> that leaves the mending?

<ypy> its a mess right now
<JavelinFury> kk
<JavelinFury> so thats done
<ypy> thanks for taking care of that :)
<JavelinFury> the wheat farm has to be 50 blocks away from both the iron farm and the villager farm
<JavelinFury> so maybe the other side of the tomb?
<ypy> sure sounds good
<ypy> how come it has to be?
<JavelinFury> they wont work if there too close
<ypy> hm was there a server restart?
<JavelinFury> tps is fine
<ypy> no i mean did one already happen
<ypy> wondering how 2py got kicked
<JavelinFury> yeah idk how that happened
<JavelinFury> does it say he was timed out?

<ostrich1414> Lol
<ostrich1414> I guess they spawn in them?
<Yukarion> I guesss
<ostrich1414> Weird
<Yukarion> I think this is actually the first woodland mansion I've seen
<Yukarion> They're bigger than I thought they were
<ostrich1414> Yeah this is the first I've been too too
<ostrich1414> Yeah they're huge
<ostrich1414> I haven't even explored every room yet
<Yukarion> and there's several floors!
<ostrich1414> I just got some Totems of Undying
<ostrich1414> Damn, is there another floor?
<ostrich1414> I'm only on the second
<Yukarion> Found another cat statue
<ostrich1414> Lmao
<Yukarion> And there's a loft here
<ostrich1414> I just looked it up, they can also spawn chicken statues
<Yukarion> With a chest in it!
<Ultra_Badass> is anyone selling mending books?
<ostrich1414> Oh sweet
<clipchip> sure ultra

<Ultra_Badass> sorry to derail the convo :P

<Ultra_Badass> tyvm
<clipchip> thanks
<Ultra_Badass> I'm travelling and don't want to take a chance
<Ultra_Badass> hey Yukarion, are you able to tell where the last place someone died is?
<Yukarion> Theoretically yes, but that would be considered unfair
<Ultra_Badass> even if it's me?
<Yukarion> ^^
<Ultra_Badass> I don't have a minimap thing installed right now :(
<Yukarion> Sorry
<ypy> hey clip
<clipchip> yea?
<Ultra_Badass> thanks a lot
<ypy> you know that huge chat log you're using to train your bot
<clipchip> yes
<ypy> would you be open to sharing it?
<clipchip> no
<ypy> aww ok
<clipchip> problem is a lot of the logs probably have coords and other stuff in it
<clipchip> since it takes my private messages too
<ypy> oh lol
<Yukarion> Could you sort for messages that match ^<\S\+> ?
<clipchip> maybe
<ypy> whooops
<ostrich1414> Yikes
<clipchip> i know jav and me sometimes don't use /tell when no one else is on though
<ypy> took my elytra off haha
<Yukarion> Oh yeah, I guess that would be the problem with sharing chat logs
<Yukarion> That people don't use /tell when nobody else is on
<ypy> well i'm gonna set 2py up to record stuff
<ypy> so dont tell your coords while it's around
<ypy> cuz they're going on github
<ostrich1414> Clip doesn't wanna share all the fanfiction he has about me :O
<Ultra_Badass> :(
<clipchip> that's between you, yukar, and me ostrich

<ostrich1414> I just looked it up, they can also spawn chicken statues
<Yukarion> With a chest in it!
<Ultra_Badass> is anyone selling mending books?
<ostrich1414> Oh sweet
<clipchip> sure ultra
<clipchip> what can you pay with
<Ultra_Badass> sorry to derail the convo :P
<Ultra_Badass> what do you need?
<ostrich1414> Fl*p you Ultra!!!!!1!1!1!
<clipchip> diamonds
<Ultra_Badass> how many?
<clipchip> how many books do you want
<Ultra_Badass> three
<clipchip> 15 diamonds?
<Ultra_Badass> okay
<ypy> i'll do it for 14
<clipchip> ypy's bot isn't as cool as mine though
<clipchip> i wouldn't trade with that guy
<Ultra_Badass> I don't know you that well ypy
<ypy> yeah im pretty sketchy
<clipchip> i can do it for 14 as well though
<Ultra_Badass> okay
<Ultra_Badass> give me a few minutes
<Ultra_Badass> oh
<Ultra_Badass> mind if I use that again real quick? :)
<Ultra_Badass> tyvm
<clipchip> thanks
<Ultra_Badass> I'm travelling and don't want to take a chance
<Ultra_Badass> hey Yukarion, are you able to tell where the last place someone died is?
<Yukarion> Theoretically yes, but that would be considered unfair
<Ultra_Badass> even if it's me?
<Yukarion> ^^
<Ultra_Badass> I don't have a minimap thing installed right now :(
<Yukarion> Sorry
<ypy> hey clip
<clipchip> yea?
<Ultra_Badass> thanks a lot
<ypy> you know that huge chat log you're using to train your bot
<clipchip> yes
<ypy> would you be open to sharing it?
<clipchip> no
<ypy> aww ok
<clipchip> problem is a lot of the logs probably have coords and other stuff in it
<clipchip> since it takes my private messages too
<ypy> oh lol
<Yukarion> Could you sort for messages that match ^<\S\+> ?
<clipchip> maybe
<ypy> whooops
<ostrich1414> Yikes
<clipchip> i know jav and me sometimes don't use /tell when no one else is on though
<ypy> took my elytra off haha
<Yukarion> Oh yeah, I guess that would be the problem with sharing chat logs
<Yukarion> That people don't use /tell when nobody else is on
<ypy> well i'm gonna set 2py up to record stuff
<ypy> so dont tell your coords while it's around
<ypy> cuz they're going on github
<ostrich1414> Clip doesn't wanna share all the fanfiction he has about me :O
<Ultra_Badass> :(
<clipchip> that's between you, yukar, and me ostrich
<clipchip> ;)
<ostrich1414> Oh, tee-hee ;) <3
<ostrich1414> Thanks
<ypy> np
<Yukarion> BTW ypy: The MC client automatically logs everything
<ypy> wait what
<Yukarion> It's in your ~/.minecraft/logs dir
<ypy> omg
<TheUltraOrc> hahahaha
<ypy> hmm i dont have one of those
<ypy> probably somewhere else on mac
<Yukarion> It's the same place the screenshots are saved

<Yukarion> So, how's your bot programmed?
<ypy> lol its just a markov chain
<ypy> but it worked surprisingly well when i was testing it offline
<Yukarion> Is it based entirely on full messages people haev written?
<ypy> yeah, i had about 20k lines of actual chats that it's seeded with
<ypy> wow it's so slow to do the training on this cheap scaleway box

<ypy> lemme know if it gets annoying and i'll dial that second knob back even further
<Yukarion> Yeah, people can just /ignore it if it gets nanoying
<ypy> whoa
<Yukarion> Hey 2py what's up?

<2py> way trial and error is the best
<Yukarion> No 2py, the answer is cactus
<2py> this before Yukar? Have you seen an area like
<Yukarion> The messages don't seem to be complete, are they exact messages that somebody else has written?
<2py> well it's trained on those but should be trying to assemble its own sentences
<Yukarion> Ah ok
<ypy> might need some tweaking tho
<Yukarion> Yeah some of it seems kind of nonsensical
<ypy> oh it's definitely gonna be nonsensical
